 *
 * ```kotlin
 * exists<Int> { i -> 0 <= i && i < n && pred(i) }

 *
 * does not verify even when the body is trivially satisfiable and a trigger is present. The
 * lowering is not the gap; the solver does not find the witness. The suspected cause is that
 * model-based quantifier instantiation is disabled in the Z3 configuration Silicon ships with,
 * MBQI being the primary mechanism by which a solver finds an existential witness.
 *
 * Workaround: place the witness in a **precondition** or carry it through a **loop invariant**
 * rather than asserting it as a postcondition.
